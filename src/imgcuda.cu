// imgcuda.cu -- CUDA implementations of image processing functions.
// This file contains the CUDA implementations of the image processing functions declared in imgcuda.h.
// The functions in this file are optimized for performance on NVIDIA GPUs, and may use CUDA-specific features
// such as shared memory, texture memory, and CUDA kernels.
